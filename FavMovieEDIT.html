<center><b><i><h1> John Wick</center></b></i></h1>
<i>John Wick</i> is a movie of a simple man who is trying to live a peaceful life after the passing of his wife Helen (Bridget Moynahan) whom succumbed to a terminal illness, with a puppy he had recieved as a last gift.<br>
John (Keanu Reeves) sets out to get his new companion the necesseties such as food and toys. He drives his signature 1969 Boss 429 Mustang to a gas station on the way back to his home. A group of russian hooligans step out of a car<br>
to get a refil, and one notices John's car. The russian (Alfie Allen) compliments the car, and asks how much. John says that she's not for sale, and is met with the comment in russian, everything has a price. To his suprise, John says not this in russian.<br>
Assumingly, another russian man (Toby Leonard Moore) pulls the young man away, and tells John to have a nice day. Later that night, John's dog Daisy jumps off the bed in a rush, and goes downstairs. John assumes that she needs to go, and heads down as well.<br>
He gets struck with a bat by masked men, and beaten. They hear Daisy whining, and kill her too. John is punched in the face by one of the masked men, who reveals his face before doing so. John wakes up, finds his car to be stolen, and goes on the hunt.<br>
He tears through the russian mafia, finding out that the russian man is Iosef Tarasov, Viggo Tarasov's (Michael Nyqvist) son, whom he once worked for, and was well aware of what John was, and what he'd left behind. John soon gets Iosef, killing him<br>
before he can finish his sentance, and heads for Viggo after he finds out about Viggo killing his friend Marcus (Willem Dafoe), and soon ends him in a hand to hand fight on the docks with rain pouring down. Completing his task, John<br>
lays down, and watches his phone, with a video of his lost wife, and bleeds from his many wounds, and falls asleep. He then wakes up after hearing his wife call to him, breaks into a nearby veternarian clinic, stiches his wounds, and sees a dog<br>
looking at him, with hopeful eyes. John takes the dog, and begins walking home.
